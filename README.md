## Final abstract

Pollinators around the world play a central role in our agriculture with an estimated economic benefit of ‚Ç¨235bn per year. Up to 75% of our crops are dependent on pollination and honey bees account for most of it. Yet, in Europe and the USA the bee population has been declining at an alarming rate during the last decades. [1]

With this project, we first look at the factors of bee population decline using surveys from the [US Departement of Agriculture](https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/). Secondly, we try to identify where the bees are dying in the USA. This leads us to look at their impact on the economy, be it as pollinators or honey producers. We highlight the patterns in honey trade and production around the world and shed light on dirty honey tricks.

## Final research questions

- Can we find culprits for the Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) cases in the US?
- Do some patterns appear as to where the bees die in the US?
- California accounts for 80% of the world almond production, what is the impact of bees on this industry in the 21st century?
- How to cluster countries based on their honey import/export around the world?
- Some countries appear to have hyper-productive beehives, how can we explain this phenomenon?
