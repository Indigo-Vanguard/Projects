# What Recipe Will Doom/Save the Planet?

# Abstract
Online shopping has become more prevalent than ever with the rise of the Internet.
Our project will compare the online grocery shopping habits with the more classical ones.
While establishing the fundamental differences between the 2 datasets, their habits would be visualized by showing which recipes could be prepared with what they bought.
In parallel, the UNO's dataset about food and agriculture would show which habits are the most suited ones for their local agriculture.
Any significant deviation would show that the products are imported for the pleasure of their buyer.
Using all this data, the end result would show which possible recipes are the most suited ones for any country, and which ones are a probable cause of our global CO2 production.

# Research questions
- Which recipes are the most adapted for any country?
- Are consumers choosing good, mixed, or bad alternatives?
